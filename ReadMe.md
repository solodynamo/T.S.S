Get yourserlf get going with typescript which is one of the hindrance we most often face.

Project Structure:
  - ./src - It is where our ts code will reside.
  - ./dist - It is where our js code will reside here after getting compiled by tsc.

### Installation



Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install typescript -g
$ cd T.S.S/src
$ tsc -w
```
-w : It watches for ts code change and automatically compiles to js in dist/

-Write ts code in app.ts and get app.js in dist/ which is as easy it
